# Phase 1 learning loop: state

This records verified progress against the
[Phase 1 contract](phase1-learning-loop-contract.md). An item is listed as
done only after:
- its tests pass;
- its pull request is open;
- its Sol (Codex) review has been answered.

Each entry records the checks that ran. Each item has its own section, so
stacked pull requests edit different lines.

## Contract

October 20, 2026:
- The contract was drafted from:
  - the October 18 review and its probes;
  - the open Phase 0 pull requests, #7 to #18;
  - the code.
- The owner answered decisions 3, 4, 5 and 9, chose the integration base
  and Sol reviews, and asked for a display time-zone setting.
- The Phase 0 tips' pairwise conflicts were found with `git merge-tree`.
- No owner database was touched.
- **Sol (Codex) round 1 (`gpt-6.1-sol`).** Five findings, all accepted into
  the contract:
  - **High:** Unresolved had no defined settlement path. It now takes no new
    links, its existing links still settle it, and it closes through the
    normal transition and event.
  - **Medium:**
    - the monitor watch now keeps the existing bounded window, which starts
      at the declaration;
    - completion is cleared when a Play leaves Unresolved;
    - process lanes now have a population, period times, precedence and a
      paginated drill-down;
    - Duplicate now opens an unsaved Draft that the plan checks gate.

  The legacy-completion migration was found sound.
